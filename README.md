 # Hi! I’m @Aimarest <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
 
 👀 I’m interested in learning about programming
 
 🌱 I did an intensive online web development course with Adalab (Feb '22 - May '22).
Then I continued training thanks to other online platforms with Udemy, OpenBootcamp and Platzi.
I had the opportunity to do a software test automation bootcamp with Ntt Data, and I'm currently in training to work as a QA in that company.
 
 💞️ I love learning new things every day!, I'm very excited and motivated!!
